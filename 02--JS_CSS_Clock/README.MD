## About

App that estimates the amount of time between two dates.

## FAQ

* Why is it an "estimate"?
    * It is notoriously difficult to account for all the calendar variations that happen between two dates.  Thanks to irregular month lengths and leap years, the farther apart two dates are, the more difficult it is to count the exact number of days between them.  And then there are leap seconds!
