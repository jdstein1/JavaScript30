    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age; // creating a copy of original variable.

    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2);

    let name = 'Mark';
    let name2 = name; // creating a copy of original variable.
    console.log(name, name2);
    name = 'Steve';
    console.log(name, name2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players; // creating a reference to the original array.
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Dan';

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players, team);

    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. 
    // They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[1] = 'Don';
    console.log(players, team2);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3[2] = 'Ron';
    console.log(players, team3);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[0] = 'Jeff';
    console.log(players, team4);

    // or also this
    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[0] = 'Hazel';
    console.log(players, team5);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name:'Bill Haley',
      age:44
    };
    console.log(person);

    // and think we make a copy:
    const guy = person;
    guy.id = 25434;
    console.log(person, guy);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const guy2 = Object.assign({}, person, {age:71,phone:274653});
    console.log(person, guy2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const guy3 = {...person}; // not available yet

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const clone = Object.assign({},me);
    clone.name = 'Jeffrey';
    // nodes deeper than 1 level are still references
    clone.social.twitter = '@bhjdsfbvjdhbjb';
    console.log(me, clone);
